**Royal English School, Matale was founded in 1997 with the vision of creating an ideal society of English educated men and women, not only of high intellectual and academic attainments but more importantly virtuous individuals with character and correct sense of values.**

**Our absolute mission is to contribute to build up the future generation of our motherland. We are proud to claim that Royal English School has produced hundreds of well-informed personalities who have risen to commendable levels nationally and internationally.**

**Our academic classes extend from Play Group for three year old kids to G.C.E (Ordinary Level) according to the Sri Lankan Syllabus. Our students also get the opportunity to sit the IPSCE, IJSCE, ISSCE Examinations which are conducted by the Association of International Schools in Sri Lanka and also the IAS Examination conducted by the University of New South Wales.**

**While English is the medium of instruction, other languages, Sinhalese and Tamil are also taught. Place of prominence is given to the teaching of Religion. Information Technology (IT) has also gained much ground among students.**

**The fact that our students have gained good progress in their academic work is proved by the results of the Public Examinations.**
